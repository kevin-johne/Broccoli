# Response to Farmdrop code test

This is a small application showing products from several farmers.

The data is pulled from a graphql endpoint and lists all products. Each product can have variants
and a reduced price. Of course a product can be added to a basket. 

For this small application I used react context to store global state.

There are as well some tests, if the components are rending correctly and functions as expected.

## Commands
`npm run start` - start dev server

`npm run test` - testing application

`npm run build` - prod ready bundle

Thank you for looking at this little app.
