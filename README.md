# Response to Farmdrop code test

This is a small application, showing products from several farmers.

The data is pulled from a graphql endpoint. Listed products can have variants
and as always can be added to the basket. The basket state is saved in a React Context.

There are as well some tests, if the components are rending correctly and functioning expected.

## Commands
`npm run start' - start dev server
`npm run test` - testing application
`npm run build` - prod ready bundle
